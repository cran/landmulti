Description: Contains functions for a flexible varying-coefficient landmark model by incorporating multiple short-term events into the prediction of long-term survival probability. For more information about landmark prediction please see Li, W., Ning, J., Zhang, J., Li, Z., Savitz, S.I., Tahanan, A., Rahbar.M.H., (2023+).
